## Getting started

Make sure you have the create-react-app installed globally, then cd client folder and run npm install to resolve all dependencies.

Run npm start for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

cd api and run npm install, then run npm start to load server.
